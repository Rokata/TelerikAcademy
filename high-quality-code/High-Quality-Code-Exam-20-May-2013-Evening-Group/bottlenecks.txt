A possible bottleneck is the following link in the ChangePhone method: 

var oldNumberEntries = this.phonesDictionary[oldNumber].ToList(); 

If the method is called many times (thousands) and if oldNumber always exists 
the application will become really slow as the ToList() operation is slow.
Furthermore, there might be many phone entries corresponding  to the 
oldNumber parameter.
Since it is necessary to make a change everywhere oldNumber appears 
(in all the corresponding entries), we might need all the entries so 
the change is difficult.
